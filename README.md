# ‚öΩ Player Re-Identification in a Single Video Feed

This project performs **player re-identification** in a football match video using a single camera feed. Each player is assigned a unique ID that remains consistent even when the player leaves and re-enters the frame.

---

## üìå Objective

To detect and track players in a 15-second video using:

- YOLOv11 (custom trained model)
- Deep SORT tracker

---

## üéØ Approach and Methodology

1. **Detection**:
   - Used a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model (`best.pt`) to detect players, referees, and the ball.

2. **Tracking**:
   - Used the Deep SORT algorithm to track each player across frames.
   - Maintained the same ID for players who temporarily leave and reappear in the video.

|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `main.py`             | Main Python script to run the tracking      |
| `15sec_input_720p.mp4`| Input video clip                            |
| `best.pt`             | YOLOv11 model for detection *(not in repo)* |
| `README.md`           | Project overview and instructions           |
| `requirements.txt`    | Python dependencies                         |

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. üîß Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### 2. üíæ Download YOLOv11 Model

Since `best.pt` exceeds GitHub's upload size, download it from Google Drive:

üëâ [Download best.pt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-5fOSHOSB9UXyP_enOoZNAMScrePVcMD/view)

> After downloading, place it in the same folder as `main.py`.

### 3. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Tracker

```bash
python main.py
```

* A video window will open showing players with bounding boxes and consistent IDs.
* Press `Q` to exit.

---

## üìΩÔ∏è Example Output

Each player will have a green bounding box with a label like:

```
ID: 1
ID: 2
```

These IDs stay the same even if a player disappears and comes back.
